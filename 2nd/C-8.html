<p><em>WHEREAS, it is recognized that the most terrible crimes are in such direct contravention of the rights of citizens and the well-being of society;</em></p>

<p><em>AND WHEREAS reformation of these criminals is not feasible, the release of said criminals is not desirable, nor is their permanent detainment fiscally responsible;</em></p>
